# The Wallet App

This project will help you practice most of the knowledge you've learned so far in JavaScript.


You are required to create this using OOP and only use Vanilla JS (HTML, CSS, JS).

## Functionality
- The app should be able to manage multiple wallets.
- A wallet has a name, starting balance, a list of Transactions, and description.
- There should be 2 types of transactions (Income and Expense).
- A transaction should have a date, tags, and a note.
- A user can jump between the wallets and create wallets.

### Bonus
- The wallets should be saved and loaded from local storage (with thier data).

## Classes
Every object in this app should be a class. For instance:
- Wallet
- Transaction
- Expense
- Income
- Currency

And class related logic should be put as methods inside the respective class.

Listeners and UI updating methods can sit outside of the classes.
